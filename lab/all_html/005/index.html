        One dollar <mark>and</mark> eighty-seven cents.
        That was all.
        <mark>And</mark> sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one <mark>and</mark> two at a time by bulldozing the grocer <mark>and</mark> the vegetable man <mark>and</mark> the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing
        implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar <mark>and</mark> eighty-sevencents.
        <mark>And</mark> the next day would be Christmas.

        There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little
        couch <mark>and</mark> howl.So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, <mark>and</mark> smiles, with sniffles predominating.

          While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.

          In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go,
          <mark>and</mark> an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring.
          Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."

        The "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest <mark>and</mark> unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home <mark>and</mark> reached his flat above he was called
        "Jim" <mark>and</mark> greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.

        Della finished her cry <mark>and</mark> attended to her cheeks with the powder rag.
        She stood by the window <mark>and</mark> looked out dully at a gray cat walking a
        gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, <mark>and</mark> she
        had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving
        every penny she could for months, with this result.  Twenty dollars a
        week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.
        They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a
        happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something
        fine <mark>and</mark> rare <mark>and</mark> sterling--something just a little bit near to being
        worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.
