			The essay, <i>Container Technologies</i>, by ZoÃ« Sofia, discusses the function and the view of the container.  The idea of containing has been labeled as "feminine" in the essay.<br>
			For this project, the location I chose is my bathroom. The bathroom is a place that humans need in everyday life. The way that I interpreted the feminine characteristic of the container in order to choose the bathroom as a location is that in public, most of the bathrooms are divided by gender and do have a difference. And especially my bathroom is more likely to be a "feminine" one. The process of filtering containers by the standard of being more or less feminine was unclear. 
			Therefore, filters for the containers in my bathroom are selected by where the containers are positioned in the bathroom :
			<i>fixed on the wall, fixed on the ground, hanging, and movable.</i><br>
			Also, visually represented containers in two "fixed" filters are positioned on either the wall or ground section of background image, "hanging" containers swing when they are clicked, and viewers can actually drag and move around the ones in "movable".
